Note: There is a [later version](https://mod-network.com/detail/28702/2.1.0.4) of this map on Mod-Network. It changes some of the fields and roads, moves the shop location and requires a new save game. This AutoDrive route may also be useful as a foundation for 2.1.0.4.

# Route Type Preference

Route map was built in single player using "New Farmer".

Turning standard for all roads and field access is a Lizard Warrior with Wilson Pacesetter trailer. Since this map has collisions on sign posts and telephone poles, the routes will use a wide turn in some cases to allow for a long trailer. Tighter areas such as animal pens have been tested with a small/medium tractor with a smaller trailer such as Kr√∂ger Argoliner TKD 302.

## Map Notes
There are two game-breaking bugs that can be fixed with some minor editing of the map files. These are fixed in later versions of the map, but it requires a new save game.

1. There is a bug in the loading trigger placement for **Cow Pen 6** in map version 2.1.0.2 that makes it unusable. This can be fixed by exiting the game, unzipping the map and modifying `placeables\animalHusbandry\cowPen06.i3d` with a text editor.

    Find line 76 which contains `animalLoadTrigger` and look at the `translation` value. Change the translation part to say `translation="44.5134 -2.2 1.68075"`.

2. Grass shows on all textures when using the landscaping tool. This can be fixed by editing `maps\data\mapWT.xml` and finding the `<groundTypeMappings>` section. Remove the text `paintableFoliageId="1"` from each ground type that you do not wish to have any grass. It is suggested to leave grass on types `grass`, `forestGround`, `grass_moss` and `grass_dry` and remove it from the rest.

When performing any edits on a map:
- Make a backup copy of the original map file.
- The map can be run from your mod folder in an unzipped state, but do not keep the original zip in the mod folder or it will ignore your changes.
- As a consideration to the map author and all their hard work, do not distribute edited copies of the map.
